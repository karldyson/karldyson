## About me...

Mostly, I'm:

- A Father
- A DNS geek
- A Motorsport UK Clerk of the Course
- A Photographer

### Career

I have a background in the design and operations of networks and infrastructure.

I've worked in a bunch of industries at various times, but predominantly technology.

I've typically specialised in global internet connected platforms.

Over the last couple of decades I've become quite a bit of a DNS geek and in the last decade, added a side order of top level domain registry to that.

### Motorsport

I'm a Motorsport UK [Clerk of the Course](https://www.motorsportuk.org/volunteers/officials/clerk-of-the-course/) for the Race and Speed and so you'll find me at a number of Motorsport events at weekends and bank holidays.

## How to reach me

Mostly, you'll find me at:

 - [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@karldyson)
 - [My Blog](https://karld.blog)

...and often in a DNS or Registry related working group meeting at IETF events

## Hi there 👋

This is authoritatively where I keep code.

You may have seen some of this or other code in my old Bitbucket account, but all of that has moved, or is in the process of moving here.

I've not yet been arsed to go and tidy up the repos there and set the readme files to tell folks to come here.

Mostly, this is stuff I've written for myself over the years.

It's in a variety of languages as I've attempted to learn one or more over time.

I'm not a software developer, I just write stuff that I want or need to and I try to make it Not Too Crap™.

If you have suggestions, comments, feedback, etc on any of it, that's always welcome: I like to learn and improve.

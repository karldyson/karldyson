## Hi there 👋

This is authoritatively where I keep code.

You may have seen some of this or other code in my old Bitbucket account, but all of that has moved, or is in the process of moving here.

I've not yet been arsed to go and tidy up the repos there and set the readme files to tell folks to come here.

Mostly, this is stuff I've written for myself over the years.

It's in a variety of languages as I've attempted to learn one or more over time.

I'm not a software developer, I just write stuff that I want or need to and I try to make it Not Too Crap™.

If you have suggestions, comments, feedback, etc on any of it, that's always welcome: I like to learn and improve.

## About me...

Mostly, I'm:

- A Father
- A DNS geek
- A Motorsport UK Clerk of the Course
- A Photographer

### Career

I have a background in the design and operations of networks and infrastructure.

I've worked in a bunch of industries at various times, but predominantly technology.

I've typically specialised in global internet connected platforms.

Over the last couple of decades I've become quite a bit of a DNS geek and in the last decade, added a side order of top level domain registry to that.

### Motorsport

I'm a Motorsport UK [Clerk of the Course](https://www.motorsportuk.org/volunteers/officials/clerk-of-the-course/) for the Race and Speed and so you'll find me at a number of Motorsport events at weekends and bank holidays.

## How to reach me

Mostly, you'll find me at:

 - [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@karldyson)
 - [My Blog](https://karld.blog)

...and often in a DNS or Registry related working group meeting at IETF events
